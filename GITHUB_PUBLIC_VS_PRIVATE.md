## 🎯 For This Support Chatbot Project:

### Choose **PUBLIC** if:
- ✅ It's a learning project
- ✅ You want to showcase it
- ✅ You want unlimited free deployments
- ✅ You're not selling this code

### Choose **PRIVATE** only if:
- ❌ You're selling this to clients
- ❌ It contains proprietary business logic
- ❌ You need complete secrecy

## 💡 Note About Sensitive Data

**Even with a public repo, sensitive data is safe!**

Don't put these in your code (public or private):
- API keys
- Database passwords
- Secret tokens

Instead, use **Environment Variables** in Vercel:
- Settings → Environment Variables
- Only Vercel can see them
- Never exposed in your code

---

## 🔄 Can You Change Later?

**Yes!** You can change from public to private (or vice versa) anytime:
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Settings → Scroll down
3. Click "Change visibility"
4. Follow prompts

---

## ✅ My Recommendation

For this support chatbot project:
**Create a PUBLIC repository**

**Why?**
- It's a learning project
- You want it on your portfolio
- Free unlimited deployments
- Industry standard for personal projects
- Nothing sensitive in the code

If you're worried about someone "stealing" your code, remember:
- Thousands of people share their code publicly
- It helps you learn and get feedback
- Your specific implementation is still yours
- Knowledge is meant to be shared!

---

## 🚀 Bottom Line

**Public = Free, easy, and perfect for learning**
**Private = Costs money if you want unlimited deployments**

Start public, go private later if needed!
